This product depends on the Zend Framework for php and mysql, and is intended to be used
on the Zend Server Community Edition. 

-Import scripts/scheme.sql into your database and configure 
application/configs/application.ini with the database details.

-Place the content of this folder in a publicly accessible web folder and point
your browser or virtual host mechanism to public/index.php

-The default admin user is 'admin' with password 'test'.

For instructions on how to install Zend Server Community Edition refer to 
http://www.zend.com/en/products/server-ce/. Zend products can also be used on a regular
apache2/php server as long as it has access to the zend framework, but we consider that
to be outside this documents scope.
