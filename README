This software was written by IT students at Queensland University of 
Technology. It is not explicity copyrighted. Its an assignment to be handed in,
so there shouldn't be any real uses for it. Still, if our code can help you in
any way, consider it public domain.

If you for some strange reason need support for this product, it is written on
top of the Zend framework, so you should be able to easily find a consultant/programmer
online.
